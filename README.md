other users. In addition, the application has a theme switcher, a Scroll To Top
button with smooth scrolling, a filter for user cards with three options, and
also has routing and a little bit of Redux Toolkit.

links to the developer's social media, as well as navigation through the app and
a theme switch button from light to dark.
